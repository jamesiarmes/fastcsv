# FastCSV

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/fastcsv.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/fastcsv)
[![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/opennorth/fastcsv.png)](https://gemnasium.com/opennorth/fastcsv)

A fast [Ragel](http://www.colm.net/open-source/ragel/)-based CSV parser.

## Usage

```ruby
require 'fastcsv'

# Read from file.
File.open(filename) do |f|
  FastCSV.raw_parse(f) do |row|
    # do stuff
  end
end

# Read from an IO object.
FastCSV.raw_parse(StringIO.new("foo,bar\n")) do |row|
  # do stuff
end

# Read from a string.
FastCSV.raw_parse("foo,bar\n") do |row|
  # do stuff
end

# Transcode like with the CSV module.
FastCSV.raw_parse("\xF1\n", encoding: 'iso-8859-1:utf-8') do |row|
  # ["Ã±"]
end
```

## Development

    ragel -G2 ext/fastcsv/fastcsv.rl
    ragel -Vp ext/fastcsv/fastcsv.rl | dot -Tpng -o machine.png
    rake compile
    gem uninstall fastcsv
    rake install

## Why?

We evaluated [many CSV Ruby gems](https://github.com/jpmckinney/csv-benchmark#benchmark), and they were either too slow or had implementation errors. [rcsv](https://github.com/fiksu/rcsv) is fast and [libcsv](http://sourceforge.net/projects/libcsv/)-based, but it skips blank rows (Ruby's CSV module returns an empty array) and silently fails on input with an unclosed quote; nonetheless, it's an excellent alternative if you find errors in FastCSV! We looked for Ragel-based CSV parsers to copy, but they either had implementation errors or could not handle large inputs. [commas](https://github.com/aklt/commas/blob/master/csv.rl) looks good, but it performs a memory check on each character, which is overkill.
